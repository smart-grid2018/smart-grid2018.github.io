It’s in some sense the basis for real friendship. Most broken friendship may be traced back to dishonesty on one party or both. Needless to say, honesty is the precondition for human contact and the touchstone of one’s virtue.<br>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Once I had a friend named Jack in my high school years. He happened to get so addicted to computer games that he ignored his study. At first, I didn’t want to hurt his dignity by pointing out his problem directly, being afraid of harming our friendship. However, after painful struggling in my mind, I decided to be honest about his problem and had a serious conversation with him about the harm that the addiction to games may do to him. At that time, I knew my words might sound harsh and hurting. But my words somewhat worked. He finally became an excellent student after he decided to overcome his over-indulgence of playing online games.<br>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; It’s hard to always keep honest to your friends on some occasions, like pointing out their mistakes face to face. But, as long as your honesty could help him or make him a better person, your efforts will pay off soon. So, please always remember to be honest to your friend.<br><br># Part 2 Listening Comprehension<br><br>## Quick check<br><br>Conversations:&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; CBAA&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; BABC<br>Passages:&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; CAB&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; CBA<br>Recordings:&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; BCAB&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; AAB&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; CAB<br><br>## Listening Materials<br><br>Section A<br><em>Directions: In this section, you will hear two long conversations. At the end of each conversation, you will hear some questions. Both the conversation and the questions will be spoken only once. After you hear a question, you must choose the best answer from the four choices marked A), B), C) and D). Then mark the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 1 with a single line through the centre.</em><br><br>Conversation One<br><br>M: Recently, I’m been taking gym classes to get the so-called functional fitness.<br>W: “Functional fitness”? What does it mean?<br>M: Oh, that’s a word for middle-age people like me. It means, a physical fitness that allows you to do everyday tasks well, such as being about to walk up a flight of stairs without getting out of breath, or lifting a gallon of water without hurting your shoulder.<br>W: Are these tasks very hard? They seem to be very easy to me.<br>M: That’s very lucky of you to feel like that. You know, you’re a young and energetic person. But, they’re truly very hard to me. As age creeps on me, I noticed little things. Going up the stairs with a full load of laundry, I’m a little out of breath. And going hiking with my family, I’m the last one in line. Sometimes staying fit is harder now.<br>W: Oh, it’s definitely not a good feeling. I feel for you.<br>M: Thanks. You know, now I’m 48 and married, with four teenagers.<br>W: How about your younger years? Is it hard to keep healthy then?<br>M: In my youth, I was very healthy. I was on my high school   swimming team. Actually, I grew up in a health-conscious household.<br>W: A health-conscious household?<br>M: Yes. My father played professional football, of course, when he was in his twenties. My mom was also fit and healthy.<br>W: Good work to your parents and you!<br>M: Thanks. You know, “past is past”. Now I’m feeling it’s necessary to take action to stay functionally healthy.<br>W: You said you’re taking gym classes now. I think it’s a waste of money. You could’ve found many health tips and instructional materials online.<br>M: In fact, I tried to find some ways to improve my health by myself.<br>W: Really?<br>M: Yes, I tried to walk my dog more often, go jogging in the park near my house, and I even did take online yoga classes online. But it wasn’t enough.<br>W: Ok, no wonder you turn to the gym for help now.<br><br><em>Questions 1 to 4 are based on the conversation you have just heard.</em><br><br>1.Why does the man take gym classes?<br>2.What is mentioned of the man’s father?<br>3.Why does the woman think going to gym is a waste of money?<br>4.What did the man do in his own way to improve his health?<br><br><em>1.C 2.B 3.A 4.A</em><br><br>Conversation Two<br><br>W: I heard you are back at work after the birth of your second child. How is it going at work?<br>M: Honestly speaking, not great. Basically, the guys wanted to make the point that they weren’t happy with me. You know, I left for quite a long time to take care of the baby.<br>W: Why? It’s unfair! There’s nothing wrong with your taking the time off to take care of your new-born baby. It’s the government policy in 2015 that has allowed moms and dads to share parental leave.<br>M: Anyway, I quit my job now. I know a lot of working fathers who are facing their employers’ negative reaction if they want to take a more equal share of childcare.<br>W: It seems government efforts to support fathers in the workplace have not yet delivered good intentions.<br>M: So, in a way, workplace policies have not kept up with the social changes in people’s everyday life. The outdated assumptions about men’s and women’s roles in relation to work and childcare is still a barrier to change.<br>W: That’s true. Don’t worry. Though your child is young, you can still have chance to find a part-time job to balance work and childcare.<br>M: I doubt it. In fact, I searched for part-time jobs which might fit into my schedule of taking care of my child. All the potential employers prefer my working at their workplace. And that sounds impractical to me and my child.<br><br><em>Questions 5 to 8 are based on the conversation you have just heard.</em><br><br>5.What did the man’s former employer complain about?<br>6.What’s mentioned of the government policy in 2015?<br>7.How does the man think of government efforts to support working fathers?<br>8.What may cause employers’ negative reaction to working fathers’ taking parental leave?<br><br><em>5.B  6.A  7.B  8.C</em><br><br>Section B<br><em>Directions: In this section, you will hear two passages. At the end of each passage, you will hear some questions. Both the passage and the questions will be spoken only once. After you hear a question, you must choose the best answer from the four choices marked A), B), C) and D). Then mark the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 1 with a single line through the centre.</em><br><br>Passage One<br><br>Latvians are often self-deprecating about their culture’s tendency towards introversion, but could this personality trait be the key to their creative identity?<br><br>I understood what it really meant as soon as I arrived in the Baltic state. My first day walking through Riga, Latvia’s capital city, was unlike walking through the capital of any other European country. It was more serene. The sun shone brightly as I walked towards a park, and at times it seemed like the only sources of noise were passing cars and chattering tourists. When I did see some Latvians walking together, they often did so silently and with plenty of space in between.<br><br>But why are Latvians often so reserved, at least at first? There is no definite answer to that, but studies have shown a link between creativity and a preference for solitude. Jennifer Konste, a psychologist, has seen this firsthand in her line of work; in fact, she believes that introversion is especially heightened among those in creative fields, such as authors, artists and architects. Meanwhile, other Latvian psychologists have suggested that creativity is important to Latvian self-identity, so much so that creativity is a priority in the Latvian government’s educational and economic development plans. The European Commission has reported that Latvia has one of the highest shares of the creative labour market in the European Union.<br><br>Latvians are often self-deprecating and introverted, a personality type that gets overstimulated easily and prefers solitude, quiet and reflection. Examples abound, e.g. they have many neighborhoods called Solitude, and many ingrained habits, like not smiling at strangers.<br><br><em>Questions 9 to 11 are based on the passage you have just heard.</em><br><br>9.What did the speaker find out while visiting Latvia’s capital?<br>10.What does Jennifer Konste find about introversion?<br>11.What’s said of Latvians’ personality?<br><br><em>9.C  10.A  11.B</em><br><br>Passage Two<br><br>Use your time wisely travelling between business meetings—take the train, and you can catch up on work or simply sit back and relax, all safe in the knowledge that you’ve left the traffic nightmares behind you. With free Wi-Fi and great facilities, it’s easy to work on board, and you will be guaranteed to arrive ready and recharged.<br><br>Workplace stress, if left unchecked, can lead to burnout and worse. The reasons for the rise of stress at work range from always-on electronic communications to job insecurity, to long hours to bad management. That’s the bad news. The good news is that there are a number of fairly simple ways to combat stress and greatly reduce the risk of burnout. Here are some other great ways to counter workplace stress:<br>The first tip: work out as well as working.<br><br>Exercise really does help with stress—and one of the reasons people get stressed is that they find themselves “too busy” for exercise. There are three tricks here. One is to build exercise into your daily routine. The second is to put exercise in your diary. Treat your gym session as if it’s as important as a meeting. The third is to grab micro-workouts whenever you can—and here, trains are great. Why not get off to a good start by walking to the station? Once on board, get up and walk along the aisles to stop stiffness and to get the blood circulating. Or, look up exercises you can do on the go and design yourself a regular mini programme, and you’ll get off feeling great.<br>……<br><br><em>Questions 12 to 15 are based on the passage you have just heard.</em><br><br>12.What can you do when travelling between business meetings on a train?<br>13.What may lead to the rise of stress at work?<br>14.Why is exercise important to people at work?<br>15.What exercise can one do when taking a train to work?<br><br><em>12.C  13.B  14.A  15.C</em><br><br>Section C<br><em>Directions: In this section, you will hear recordings of lectures or talks followed by some questions. The recordings will be played only once. After you hear a question, you must choose the best answer from the four choices marked A), B), C) and D). Then mark the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 1 with a single line through the centre.</em><br><br><em>Now listen to the following recording and answer questions 16 to 19.</em><br><br>A New York judge recently ordered a 30-year-old, Michael Rotondo, to move out of his parents’ home. The ruling came after the parents failed to get him to leave. He had moved back home eight years earlier and had yet to find a job. The parents ran out of patience, basically.<br>I’m pretty sure that any parent living with an adult child has at some point thought about booting them out, while others may even have thought of ways of making any return less appealing.<br><br>But just as we want them to go, to fly, to be independent and their full adult selves, there is also, disappointingly, a longing for this never to happen. We’ve created this miracle that now fills doorways. We love this miracle that now fills doorways. Here, have some toilet paper. Take it all! Need a lightbulb? Have the one from my room! So it’s complicated, and they have little choice, remember. Student debt, the economy and the cost of housing have all went completely against them. The fact is that we are just going to have to get by, which isn’t so bad as it happens, but if you’re a parent living with an adult child, you will probably be familiar with any of the following:<br><br>Firstly, the defensive pause. This refers to the small amount of fear that crosses your child’s face when you ask what they are doing later, tomorrow or next Thursday and those few seconds needed to compose a reply in case their services may be required. It may be that their services are not required. You may have asked out of genuine interest, but their twentysomething brain hears the question as potentially horrific. Will I be asked to walk the dog? Wait in for a delivery? Toilet grandpa? The defensive pause is inevitably followed by: “I’m not sure yet.” Or: “I think I’m out.”<br><br>Secondly, the milk principle. This dictates that if they use all the milk, but step back from using the last drop of it, then the carton can confidently be returned to the fridge. See also the juice principle, jam principle, cream principle, cheese principle, breakfast-cereal principle, bag-of-cashews principle. Name any food, put “principle” after it and it’ll work.<br><br>Thirdly, the law of possession. At its heart this law simply says that what is theirs is theirs and what is yours is also theirs, with particular reference to toiletries and printer paper as well as all the other things.<br><br>16.What happened to Michael Rotondo?<br>17.What feeling do parents have towards their adult children?<br>18.What causes the defensive pause in an adult child?<br>19.What does the milk principle indicate about the adult child?<br><br><em>16.B 17.C 18.A 19.B</em><br><br><em>Now listen to the following recording and answer questions 20 to 22.</em><br><br>It was just one word in one email, but it triggered huge financial losses for a multinational company. The message, written in English, was sent by a native speaker to a colleague for whom English was a second language. Unsure of the word, the recipient found two contradictory meanings in his dictionary. He acted on the wrong one.<br><br>Months later, senior management investigated why the project had failed, costing hundreds of thousands of dollars. “It all traced back to this one word,” says Christina Clarke, a UK-based communications skills and intercultural trainer, who didn’t reveal the tricky word because it is highly industry-specific and possibly identifiable. “Things got out of control because both parties were thinking the opposite.”<br>When such misunderstandings happen, it’s usually the native speakers who are to blame. Ironically, they are worse at delivering their message than people who speak English as a second or third language, according to Clarke.<br><br>“A lot of native speakers are happy that English has become the world’s global language. They feel they don’t have to spend time learning another language,” says Clarke. “But… often you have a meeting full of people from different countries communicating in English and all understanding each other and then suddenly the American or British walks into the room and nobody can understand them.”<br><br>“Native speakers of English generally are monolingual and are not very good at adapting to language variation,” professor Jennifer Jenkins, professor of global Englishes at the UK’s University of Southampton, says. The non-native speakers, it turns out, speak more purposefully and carefully, typical of someone speaking a second or third language. Native speakers of English, on the other hand, often talk too fast for others to follow, and use jokes, slang and references specific to their own culture, says Clarke. In emails, they use confusing abbreviations such as ‘OOO’, instead of simply saying that they will be out of the office. “The native English speaker… is the only one who might not feel the need to accommodate or adapt to the others,” she adds.<br><br>With non-native English speakers in the majority worldwide, it’s the native speakers of English who may need to make changes when communicating with non-native speakers. “Native speakers are at a disadvantage when you are in a lingua franca situation,” where English is being used as a common means of communication, says Jennifer Jenkins. “It’s the native English speakers that are having much difficulty understanding and making themselves understood.”<br><br>20.What caused the huge financial loss in the multinational company?<br>21.Why are non-native speakers considered as effective speakers?<br>22.What may cause native speakers to be misunderstood by non-native speakers?<br><br><em>20.A  21.A  22.B</em><br><br><em>Now listen to the following recording and answer questions 23 to 25.</em><br><br>January is a good time for downloading health and fitness apps and putting those Christmas present fitness trackers to work. But do they actually help you stay motivated? Can tech help?<br><br>When Sarah, 34, a law professor from Australia, wanted to lose weight last year, she took the unusual approach of placing bets that she would achieve her exercise goals. Breast cancer had stopped her exercise routine, and she’d gained weight during a year which included three operations, she says.<br><br>“I was returning to exercise by hiking and trying to lose some of the weight I’d put on while being inactive,” she says. She began a new exercise routine eight weeks after finishing breast reconstruction surgery. With a wearable activity tracker, she monitored the steps she took each day and the calories she burned. But she also motivated herself with an app, Step Bet, that let her bet whether she would achieve her exercise goals. “I did three one-month bets and three six-month bets, and lost 7kg, that is, 10% of my body weight,” says Sarah. “I like losing fat. I don’t like losing money. The effect? Motivation!” she explains.<br><br>But it’s how we use such data that matters, argues Anil Aswani, an assistant professor in industrial engineering and operations research at the University of California, Berkeley. “Personalized goal setting is a very important aspect of these apps,” he says. The better exercise apps learn from how you’ve done in the past to tailor your goals, he argues. And doing this builds a sense of achievement, which behavioural psychologists say is important in altering your habits.<br><br>“If you’re effective at meeting goals today, it boosts your confidence and makes you more likely to meet your goals in the future,” says Prof Aswani.<br><br>Around 90% of users who make it to their fourth workout continue to use such apps for the next two months, he says. Most of the data comes from people “20 to 50 years old”, he says, so the next challenge is gathering more data from older exercisers, and other non-typical groups, such as people with injuries.<br><br>With the World Health Organisation saying obesity is now more common than under-nutrition, researchers agree apps based on health and psychological research have the potential to transform how we eat and exercise.
